# 🌈 What is Neurodiversity?

**Neurodiversity** is the natural variation in how human brains work.  
It includes different ways of thinking, learning, feeling, moving, sensing, and interacting with the world. Neurodivergent people aren't broken or disordered — just wired differently.

Being neurodivergent may mean having one or more of these neurotypes (more below!). Neurodiversity is *not* a condition to be fixed — it's a spectrum of human experience worth understanding and respecting.
